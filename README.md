## Hello allðŸ‘‹ I'm Aaron Brackett, a CS & Cybersecurity student at Old Dominion University

I'm currently learning to program in Java and C++ mainly with a bit of Ruby and Rust.
I've learned to program in Python prior to this.
I've also learned to use Linux for administrative tasks as well as to aid in software development.
I'm looking for help breaking into the career field.
I enjoy analyzing and debugging code as I have a knack for problem solving.
My current role is an electronics technician where I test, troubleshoot, and perform root cause analysis for communication networks.
An ideal role to me would be an analyst, administrator, tester, or developer.
A fun fact about me is that I'm a former athlete and used to play professional basketball in Europe.
